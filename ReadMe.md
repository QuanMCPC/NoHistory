(WARNING: This ReadMe contains quite a number of mistakes since I haven't got the time.)

### What is this?
NoHistory, is an extension for Firefox user to prevent some webpages from getting saved from history, without opening a private window. It's free, open-source, and can help you in *certain* situation. It's also my very first extension and just a project I made when I was bored.

### How to build?
Run `npm run build` in the root directory, and all the nessesary files will be generated into the `build` folder.

Run `npm run watch` in the root directory, and the files will be build directly in the `src` directory and will be updated automatically for development purpose.

To install the required dependencies (which is just type definition), run `npm install` in the root directory.

(Note that the `build` and `watch` command will only run in Windows. But you can create build script based on the batch script for other platforms.)
